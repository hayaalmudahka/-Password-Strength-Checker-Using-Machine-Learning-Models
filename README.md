# Password-Strength-Checker-Using-Machine-Learning-Modeles
Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password against guessing or brute-force attacks. In its usual form, it estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly.Machine learning models were used to decide whether the passwords were weak, medium or strong.
